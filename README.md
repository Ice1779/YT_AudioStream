# YT_AudioStream
This is a simple script that can stream audio from youtube based on search results you give.
You should have VLC media player installed on your system to use this.

Binary exec(windows)-Not available since I dont have a windows computer 
Linux- If you're using linux then you're skilled enough to compile your own binary or maybe just use it with the interpreter.
